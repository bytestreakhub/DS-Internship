## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an Age and Gender Predictor using OpenCV in Python. The predictor categorizes age into predefined intervals and classifies gender as either Male or Female.

## Installation


. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

. Download the pre-trained models from the provided link and place them in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Place an image named `image.jpg` in the project directory.

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python age_gender_detection.py
    ```

3. The script will process the image and display it with the predicted age and gender.

## Dataset

The pre-trained models used in this project can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z4HiXzOED6y_X9A8XoP_xrZZLpGsHtII).

## Results

The output will display the input image with bounding boxes around detected faces, along with the predicted age and gender.

## Improvements

- You can enhance the model by using more advanced deep learning models such as YOLOv5 for better accuracy.
- Experiment with different pre-trained models and datasets to improve the detection performance under various lighting conditions and backgrounds.
