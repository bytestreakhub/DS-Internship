# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains a simple movie recommendation system that provides suggestions to users based on their preferences and browsing history. The system is built using collaborative filtering with the SVD algorithm from the `Surprise` library.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of two files:
- `movies.csv`: Contains movie information such as movie ID, title, and genres.
- `ratings.csv`: Contains user ratings for movies, including user ID, movie ID, rating, and timestamp.

### Sample `movies.csv`:

```
movieId,title,genres
1,Toy Story (1995),Adventure|Animation|Children|Comedy|Fantasy
2,Jumanji (1995),Adventure|Children|Fantasy
3,Grumpier Old Men (1995),Comedy|Romance
4,Waiting to Exhale (1995),Comedy|Drama|Romance
5,Father of the Bride Part II (1995),Comedy
6,Heat (1995),Action|Crime|Thriller
7,Sabrina (1995),Comedy|Romance
8,Tom and Huck (1995),Adventure|Children
9,Sudden Death (1995),Action
10,GoldenEye (1995),Action|Adventure|Thriller
```

### Sample `ratings.csv`:

```
userId,movieId,rating,timestamp
1,1,4.0,964982703
1,3,4.0,964981247
1,6,4.0,964982224
1,47,5.0,964983815
1,50,5.0,964982931
2,1,5.0,964982400
2,3,5.0,964981208
2,6,4.0,964982400

## Installation

To run the project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- surprise

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas surprise
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
```

2. Ensure the `movies.csv` and `ratings.csv` files are in the same directory as the script.

3. Run the recommendation system script:

```bash
python movie_recommendation.py
```

### Example

The script provides movie recommendations for a specific user. You can modify the `user_id` in the `get_recommendations` function call to get recommendations for different users.

```python
# Example: Get recommendations for user with ID 1
recommended_movies = get_recommendations(1)
print("Recommended movies for user 1:")
print(recommended_movies)
```
